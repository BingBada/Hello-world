# HELLO

My name is Robert WÃ¤gar I am a Student at the Front End developer education at KYH in Stockholm.

I started coding spring of 2020. 
I took some beginner courses to learn more and now Im gonna go study at this education for 2 year.
My goal is to work with code either as a developer or would be kind of cool to teach kids and youth this stuff, 
it is the future and so are they. 
Right now Im working as a dance teacher in the styles Hip-Hop and Locking but also in to trying out other styles.
I been doing this since i was 18, teaching and learning, we are always learning it is what motives me and makes me
creative in what i do, there is space for evolution and development...
So I was thinking what is a new proffession that evolves all the time and develops.
Coding! Aight lets try it out. And now here I am a student again learning trying out stuff. 


So I just started learning coding and HTML CSS and Javascript next up is react and a frameworks. Here we Go!
