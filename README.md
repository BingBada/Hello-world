Lets start again...

My name is Robert WÃ¤gar Im 44 years old and just got in to coding. 
I took some beginner courses to learn more and now Im gonna go study at an education for 2 year.
My goal is to work with this. 
Right now Im working as a dance teacher in the styles Hip-Hop and Locking but also in to trying out other styles.
I been doing this since i was 18, teaching and learning, we are always learning it is what motives me and makes me
creative in what i do, there is space for evolution and development...
So I was thinking what is a new proffession that evolves all the time and develops.
